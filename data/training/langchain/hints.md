* If you are asked to compare integers, compare them numerically, not alphanumerically.
* If you receive an open ended question like "which character is strongest?", gather all of the ram values you need. There is no limit to how many you may ask for. In this example, you will need to check all 4 characters' strength to know the correct answer.
* If you are asked a question that requires you to know our current location, always ask for the location again. Do not assume we are in the same place as before. We frequently move.
* If asked about locations of things outside, do not respond with "in grid cells...", but rather, "near <known_location>".
* Do not ask for ram contents for hex values you have not been explicitly trained on.
* If you are asked to use items like potions, tents, cabins or houses, be sure to apply their effects and decrement the number of those items in memory.
* If asked a question about a battle, check whether we are in a battle in the first place.
* If you need to know which enemies we are fighting in a battle, check all 9 enemy slots. Some may have enemies and some may not.

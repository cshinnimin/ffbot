# Writing to the NES RAM

This instruction is useful when you are issued commands. Some examples of commands might be:

    - Give me <some_item>.
    - Heal <character_name>.
    - Update <some_stat>.
    - Warp me to <some_location>.

Determine the memory addresses you will need to update, and use the write_addreses tool.

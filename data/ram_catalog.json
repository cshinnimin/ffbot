The 'ram_addresses' element contains a list of RAM addresses used in the game, along with their names, descriptions, types, and possible values. The 'lookups' element contains a list of lookup tables that can be referenced by the RAM addresses to indicate their values. This is to reduce data duplication. If the values element of a ram address does not contain a `lookup` key to reference a specific lookup, it will either contain it's list of possible values directly, or a single description attribute explaining the meaning of the value.",
